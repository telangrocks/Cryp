# Render Deployment Fix

## Problem
The deployment was failing with:
```
ERR_PNPM_NO_PKG_MANIFEST  No package.json found in /opt/render/project/src/Cryptopulse--main/backend
```

## Root Cause
The project was configured as a pnpm monorepo but was missing:
1. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - workspace configuration file
2. `backend/package.json` - backend package configuration
3. `cloud/package.json` - cloud package configuration

When pnpm tried to install dependencies, it looked for workspace packages but couldn't find the required `package.json` files.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
```yaml
packages:
  - 'frontend'
  - 'backend'
  - 'cloud'
```

### 2. Created `backend/package.json`
Minimal package.json for the backend workspace.

### 3. Created `cloud/package.json`
Minimal package.json for the cloud workspace.

### 4. Updated `render.yaml`
- Changed build command to explicitly install pnpm globally
- Changed start command to use `node server.cjs` directly

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Deploy with Blueprint (Recommended)
Push these changes to your repository and let Render auto-deploy:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: add missing workspace configuration for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

Render will automatically detect the changes and redeploy.

### Option 2: Manual Configuration in Render Dashboard
If you prefer not to use `render.yaml`, configure directly in the Render dashboard:

1. **Root Directory**: `Cryptopulse--main/frontend`
2. **Build Command**: `npm install -g pnpm@10.18.0 && pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm build`
3. **Start Command**: `node server.cjs`

### Option 3: Deploy Frontend Only (No Workspace)
If you don't need the monorepo structure for deployment, you can isolate the frontend:

1. Set **Root Directory**: `Cryptopulse--main/frontend`
2. Ensure `frontend/package.json` has all required dependencies
3. Build command will only install frontend dependencies

## Verification

After deployment, verify:

1. ✅ Build completes successfully
2. ✅ Frontend service starts on specified port
3. ✅ Health check endpoint responds at `/health`
4. ✅ Application loads in browser

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Render service:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=10000`
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (backend API URL)
- `VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32+ character secure string)

## Troubleshooting

### If build still fails:
1. Check the build logs in Render dashboard
2. Verify Node.js version (should be 20.x)
3. Ensure `rootDir` is correctly set
4. Try clearing the build cache in Render

### If the service starts but doesn't respond:
1. Check that `server.cjs` exists in the frontend directory
2. Verify PORT environment variable is set
3. Check application logs for errors

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push these changes
2. Monitor the deployment in Render dashboard
3. Test the deployed application
4. Configure custom domain if needed

## Additional Notes

- The monorepo structure is now properly configured
- Each workspace (frontend, backend, cloud) has its own package.json
- The root package.json coordinates workspace operations
- For local development, run `pnpm install` from the root directory
